Personality Quiz: Introvert vs. Extrovert

The purpose of this Java project is to develop a personality quiz that uses multiple-choice questions to determine whether a user is more introverted or extroverted. Among the members of [Team XYZ], [Team Member 1] and [Team Member 2] were responsible for creating the project.

Project Aim

The goal of the project is to provide individuals with an understanding of their personality types and how they interact with the world around them. As a result of a series of carefully crafted questions, the quiz helps uncover the user's preferences and inclinations, which can then be used to predict whether the user is more introverted or extroverted.
